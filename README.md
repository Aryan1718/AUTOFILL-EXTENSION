# Future Updates: Enhancing User Interface and Functionality

In this version, some types of inputs, such as selection tags, are not yet fully functional. However, in the next update, these features will be implemented, ensuring a more comprehensive and seamless user experience. Additionally, I am committed to improving the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
